### Internal Bug List

* Health bug from Fortitude - bonus health stays when fortitude decreases.
* Something was null when an item got a name.
* Bonus damage from attributes doesn't count towards experience.
* Special weapons get stats re-rolled. Might not work as drops entirely.
* Chests inside of structures are not rotated properly.
* Loot drops from chests (maybe vanilla spawns) are not getting stats rolled properly. Something with the rarity might be messing it up because it's getting set as Default.
* Ghost/Banshee disappearing logic is slightly bugged.
