#####
### 0.6.0.2-alpha
#####

* Fixed modded monsters not getting levels/rarities applied to them.
	* Monsters which implement IMob will work be default - this includes monsters which extend
	EntityMob. Monsters which don't implement IMob will not work and may need custom integration.
* Fixed issue with mana resetting to zero when re-loading a world.
* Fixed some naming "Error" issues which slipped through the previous hotfix.
* Fixed crash when the game tries spawning certain entities.
* Fixed staves disappearing when used in the offhand. Staves used in the offhand will now fire correctly.
* Fixed bug where staves could block all incoming damage when in use.
* Potentially fixed bug where elemental damage blows won't give the player experience for the kill.



#####
### 0.6.0.1-alpha
#####

* Fixed some stats not updating correctly.
	* The entire system of how it gets updated and how stat bonuses
	apply will be re-written in the near future. I'll be adding all
	of the stat bonuses and balancing the current ones as well.
* Fixed randomly generated items having "Error" names.
* Fixed bug where players could hurt themselves when using a staff.
* Fixed server-side bug causing modded containers to not open.
