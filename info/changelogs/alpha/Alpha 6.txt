#####

+ Added config options for Area Level.
	+ You can now specify the starting Area Level of the three vanilla dimensions, plus a default value for modded dimensions.
	+ You can make a specific dimension have a static level, so that the Area Level remains the same throughout.
* Fixes crash when crafting a weapon when you haven't selected a class yet.
* Fixes stats glitching health/mana values when switching weapons/tools.
* Fixed issue with the max mana multiplier causing you to have massive amounts of mana when upgrading Wisdom.

#####
### 0.6.0.2-alpha

* Fixed modded monsters not getting levels/rarities applied to them.
	* Monsters which implement IMob will work be default - this includes monsters which extend

* Fixed issue with mana resetting to zero when re-loading a world.
* Fixed some naming "Error" issues which slipped through the previous hotfix.
* Fixed crash when the game tries spawning certain entities.

* Potentially fixed bug where elemental damage blows won't give the player experience for the kill.



#####
### 0.6.0.1-alpha
#####

* Fixed some stats not updating correctly.
	* The entire system of how it gets updated and how stat bonuses
	apply will be re-written in the near future. I'll be adding all
	of the stat bonuses and balancing the current ones as well.
* Fixed randomly generated items having "Error" names.
* Fixed bug where players could hurt themselves when using a staff.
* Fixed server-side bug causing modded containers to not open.
